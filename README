This is how we created these step definitions:
(Don't do this yourself! This is how the initial set of features and step definitons were populated.)

  ruby script/generate cucumber --capybara
  script/generate feature post title:string body:text published:boolean
  script/generate rspec_scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean
  rake db:migrate

After having done this, 

  rake cucumber

generated something like this

  Using the default profile...
  Feature: Manage posts
    In order to [goal]
    [stakeholder]
    wants [behaviour]

    Scenario: Register new post             # features/manage_posts.feature:6
      Given I am on the new post page       # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:18
      When I fill in "Title" with "title 1" # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:38

      And I press "Create"                  # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:26
      Then I should see "title 1"           # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:99
      And I should see "body 1"             # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:99
      And I should see "false"              # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:99
